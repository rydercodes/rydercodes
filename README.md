## About Me
As a Data Scientist, I have honed my skills in statistical analysis and machine learning, with a focus on using Python for data analysis and modeling. I am proficient in Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch, which I leverage to implement both supervised and unsupervised learning models. I find immense satisfaction in using these tools to crunch numbers and transform raw data into actionable insights. I continuously keep myself updated on the latest advancements in AI and ML, in order to enhance my data models.

In addition to my data science skills, I am also experienced in database development. I have hands-on experience with managing and optimizing databases using PostgreSQL and Neo4j. I am comfortable with data modeling, designing database structures, and writing efficient SQL queries. My knowledge extends to handling NoSQL databases, in which I have applied Neo4j for handling complex data and relationships in several projects.

A common thread in my work is a strong commitment to efficiency and accuracy. I enjoy the process of uncovering patterns and insights from data and transforming them into strategic decisions. My dual skill-set in data science and database development allows me to understand and manage the entire lifecycle of data, from its raw state to decision-making insights.

## :file_folder: Projects

- [**People Counting in Video Dataset**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Counting-People.git)
  - Analyzed a dataset consisting of videos recorded at a bus entrance in China. Annotated the images in video frames and trained a model to count the number of people passing through a specified scene using TensorFlow Object Detection.

- [**Semeion Handwritten Digit Dataset Classification**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Semeion-Handwritten-Digit-Dataset-Classification.git)
  - Performed classification of several handwritten digits in the Semeion Handwritten Digit dataset using Normalized Cut, Mean Shift, and Latent Class Analysis. Compared the performance of these three approaches to identify the most effective one.

- [**The Automated Data Warehouse**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Automated-Data-Warehouse.git)
  - Created an automated data warehouse using C++ language, which involved obtaining a specification of a report in terms of entities to be displayed and producing the SQL query for obtaining the data for the report.

- [**Information Visualization Approaches for Green House Gas Emission**](https://github.com/rydercodes/-Information-Visualization-Approaches-for-Green-House-Gas-Emission.git)
  - Designed and developed a platform using InVision Studio to show the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in different countries over the past 50 years. This platform was designed for both experts and normal users and made available on the web, phone, and ambient interfaces. This project involved analyzing a dataset of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple countries and developing effective information visualization techniques to convey the data.
