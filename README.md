## WORK EXPERIENCE
- Graph databases intern. Ca‚Äô Foscari University of Venice | 10 Months. Venice, Italy
  - Data cleaning.
  - Create a custom graph by implementing nodes and edges with the real data from flight transportation.
  - Implement algorithms to determine continuous, consecutive paths and optimizing for different paths.
  - Optimize algorithms in Neo4j and AGE by defining user-defined functions in Neo4j and PostgreSQL.
  - Implemented the functions in Java to change the structure of the cypher to get optimized solution.
  - Deploy web application to run the custom queries.
  - Identifying important nodes using centrality algorithms.
  - Finding the shortest, fastest, longest, latest, and cheapest communication paths.
  - Analyze effects of the price on length and distance of the flights between origin and destination airports.
  - Run queries on massive datasets in PostgreSQL to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.
  - Implement functions in PostgreSQL by using plpython3u extension.
## :file_folder: Projects

- [**A Model to Predict a person having diabetes based on various health metrics.**](https://github.com/rydercodes/diabetes_model_classification.git) 
  - This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health metrics. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about patients, including factors such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
    
- [**A Model to Predict Math score of the students.**](https://github.com/rydercodes/mlproject.git)
  - This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a math score based on various metrics. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about students, including factors such as gender, writing score, reading score, etc.
    
- [**A model and query language for temporal graph databases**](https://github.com/rydercodes/TemporalGraph.git)
  - The project concept is derived from a research paper titled "A model and query language for temporal graph databases," authored by Ariel Debrouvier, Eliseo Parodi, Mat√≠as Perazzo, Valeria Soliani, and Alejandro Vaisman. The paper served as the inspiration and reference for the project's ideas and the development of the query language used.

- [**People Counting in Video Dataset**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Counting-People.git)
  - Analyzed a dataset consisting of videos recorded at a bus entrance in China. Annotated the images in video frames and trained a model to count the number of people passing through a specified scene using TensorFlow Object Detection.

- [**Semeion Handwritten Digit Dataset Classification**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Semeion-Handwritten-Digit-Dataset-Classification.git)
  - Performed classification of several handwritten digits in the Semeion Handwritten Digit dataset using Normalized Cut, Mean Shift, and Latent Class Analysis. Compared the performance of these three approaches to identify the most effective one.

- [**The Automated Data Warehouse**](https://github.com/rydercodes/Automated-Data-Warehouse.git)
  - Created an automated data warehouse using C++ language, which involved obtaining a specification of a report in terms of entities to be displayed and producing the SQL query for obtaining the data for the report.

- [**Information Visualization Approaches for Green House Gas Emission**](https://github.com/rydercodes/-Information-Visualization-Approaches-for-Green-House-Gas-Emission.git)
  - Designed and developed a platform using InVision Studio to show the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in different countries over the past 50 years. This platform was designed for both experts and normal users and made available on the web, phone, and ambient interfaces. This project involved analyzing a dataset of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple countries and developing effective information visualization techniques to convey the data.
